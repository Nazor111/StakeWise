# StakeWise: DAO Investment Pool

This project implements a Decentralized Autonomous Organization (DAO) for Investment Pools using Clarity smart contracts on the Stacks blockchain.

## Description

The DAO Investment Pool allows members to pool funds and collectively invest in various projects. Voting and governance are managed through a smart contract where members vote on investment decisions, and profits are distributed based on contributions.

## Use Case

Community-driven investment funds.

## Key Features

1. Stake-based governance (members vote proportionally to their investment)
2. Automatic profit distribution
3. DAO treasury management for pooling and investing in different opportunities

## Smart Contract Functions

### Staking and Unstaking

- `stake(amount: uint)`: Allows users to stake STX tokens into the investment pool.
- `unstake(amount: uint)`: Allows users to withdraw their staked STX tokens from the pool.

### Proposal Management

- `create-proposal(description: string-ascii, amount: uint, beneficiary: principal)`: Creates a new investment proposal.
- `vote(proposal-id: uint, vote-for: bool)`: Allows members to vote on proposals.
- `execute-proposal(proposal-id: uint)`: Executes a proposal if it has passed voting.

### Read-only Functions

- `get-balance(user: principal)`: Returns the staked balance of a user.
- `get-total-pool-balance()`: Returns the total balance of the investment pool.
- `get-proposal(proposal-id: uint)`: Returns the details of a specific proposal.

## Getting Started

1. Install the [Clarinet](https://github.com/hirosystems/clarinet) development environment for Clarity smart contracts.
2. Clone this repository.
3. Use Clarinet to test and deploy the smart contract.

## Usage

1. Users stake STX tokens into the pool using the `stake` function.
2. Members can create investment proposals using the `create-proposal` function.
3. Stakers can vote on proposals using the `vote` function.
4. If a proposal passes, any member can execute it using the `execute-proposal` function.
5. Users can unstake their tokens at any time using the `unstake` function.

## Security Considerations

- Ensure proper access controls are in place for critical functions.
- Implement thorough testing of all contract functions.
- Consider adding a time lock for proposal execution to allow for community review.

## Future Improvements

- Implement a more sophisticated voting mechanism (e.g., quadratic voting).
- Add support for multiple types of assets.
- Implement a profit distribution mechanism.
